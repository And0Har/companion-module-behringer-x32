# companion-module-behringer-x32

## Getting started

Executing a `yarn` command should perform all necessary steps to develop the module, if it does not then follow the steps below.

The module can be built once with `yarn build`. This should be enough to get the module to be loadable by companion.

While developing the module, by using `yarn build:watch` the compiler will be run in watch mode to recompile the files on change.

## Changes

### v2.0.0

- Rewrite in Typescript with some linting and formatting rules.

- Added Mute feedback

- Added variables for channel names and fader levels

- Use slider inputs for fader levels
